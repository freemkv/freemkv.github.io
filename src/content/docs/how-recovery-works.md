title: How Recovery Works
description: How the sweep/patch two-pass design, the mapfile, and the mux pipeline work together to extract everything a drive can read.
---

This page explains how freemkv extracts everything a drive can read from a disc: the
two-pass sweep-and-patch design, the mapfile that drives it, and the mux pipeline that turns
recovered sectors into a playable container. The recovery engine lives in
[libfreemkv](/components/) and is shared by both the [CLI](/cli/) and [autorip](/autorip/).

## The principle

freemkv's goal is to **recover 100% of readable data** from a disc, where "readable" means
anything the drive can physically return.

That's not "best effort". The engine tolerates transient drive trouble, adapts its read
size down to a single sector when needed, and gives the drive firmware its full recovery
window for marginal sectors, so it never gives up on a sector the hardware could still
return.

## Sweep, then patch

Recovery runs as a forward **sweep** followed by one or more targeted **patch** passes. In
the CLI this is `--multipass`; in autorip it's multipass mode (`max_retries ≥ 1`).

### Pass 1: sweep

A forward, sequential read of the whole disc to an ISO, tolerant of bad sectors:

- Reads each ECC block in order. Good blocks are written and marked **Finished**.
- When a block won't read, freemkv **zero-fills** it, marks the range for recovery,
  and **keeps going**; one bad spot near the start never costs you the rest of the disc.
- A sliding window tracks the last 16 ECC-block results. When failures cross a threshold
  (calibrated from real drive data), the sweep concludes it has hit a damaged region and
  **jumps ahead**, leaving the skipped gap for the patch pass. The jump distance
  escalates the longer damage persists, then resets after a run of clean reads.
- Only a true transport failure (the drive's bridge crashing) aborts the pass.

The result is a complete ISO with good data in place and every unread region recorded in
the **mapfile** for the patch pass to work on.

### Pass N: patch

Targeted retries over only the ranges the sweep couldn't read:

- Walks bad ranges in **reverse** (highest address first, end-to-start within each
  range). The sweep jumps *forward* over damage, so good data tends to sit at the *tail*
  of an unread range; reading backward hits that good data first and converges on the true
  bad-block boundary.
- Reads a **single sector at a time**, giving each one the drive's full recovery timeout
  (60 seconds) so firmware-level error correction has every chance to succeed. It primes the
  drive cache with a few throwaway reads before each recovery read.
- Handles "not ready" sense conditions with a pause-and-retry rather than immediately
  writing the sector off.
- A sector that still can't be read after this is marked **Unreadable**.
- Watchdogs (a whole-pass timeout and a per-range time budget) prevent a hopelessly
  damaged region from stalling the run indefinitely.

Each patch pass narrows the remaining damage. Multipass stops early the moment there are no
unreadable bytes left.

:::caution[Be gentle with the drive]
Hammering the same bad sectors in tight, repeated retries can push a drive into a
fast-fail state where it stops attempting recovery at all. freemkv's patch pass is
deliberately paced (single-sector reads, recovery-timeout windows, cache priming, and skip
escalation) to coax data out of marginal media without driving the hardware into that
state.

## The mapfile

The mapfile is freemkv's record of what's been read and what hasn't. It is a
**ddrescue-compatible plain-text file**, written next to the ISO (`<image>.iso.mapfile`),
and flushed after every update so an interrupted run leaves a consistent on-disk state.

Each region of the disc carries a status:

| Status | Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **NonTried** | `?` | Not yet attempted. |
| **NonTrimmed** | `*` | A fast read failed; the range's edges still need trimming. |
| **NonScraped** | `/` | Trimmed; the interior still needs a sector-by-sector scrape. |
| **Unreadable** | `-` | The drive could not read this region this session. |
| **Finished** | `+` | Good data, recovered. |

Because the mapfile is persisted continuously, recovery is **resumable**: an interrupted
sweep or a later patch run picks up exactly where it left off, and the patch pass knows
precisely which ranges still need work. This powers [autorip's resume](/autorip/#resume)
and the CLI's auto-resuming `disc:// iso://` copy.

## Mux

Once the map is clean (or an [accepted-loss threshold](/autorip/#accepted-loss) is reached),
freemkv **muxes**: it decrypts the captured data (see [Decryption Keys](/decryption-keys/))
and writes the titles to the output container.

Muxing runs through a three-stage threaded pipeline so reading/decrypting, demultiplexing,
and codec parsing all overlap:

1. **Prefetch + decrypt**: a producer reads sectors ahead of demand and decrypts them.
2. **Demux**: a dedicated thread splits the transport/program stream into PES frames.
3. **Parse**: codec parsers turn PES frames into the elementary streams the container needs.

This keeps the drive (or ISO read) saturated instead of stalling between stages. The
library entry point is `build_iso_pipeline`; see the [library overview](/libfreemkv/) for
the API.

## Running it from the CLI

Multipass recovery is three commands: sweep, patch, then mux. The patch pass re-runs the
**same** sweep command: freemkv reads the mapfile, detects which pass it's on, and re-reads
the bad ranges from the disc. Repeat the patch as many times as you like; each run narrows
the remaining damage and stops early once nothing is left to recover.

```bash
# Sweep the disc to an ISO, then re-run the SAME command to patch the
# remaining bad ranges. Repeat until the mapfile is clean.
freemkv disc:// iso://Disc.iso --multipass

# Mux the finished ISO to MKV
freemkv iso://Disc.iso mkv://Movie.mkv
```

See the [CLI reference](/cli/) for full options.

To check a disc without writing anything, `freemkv verify` runs the read path read-only and
reports health (good, slow, recovered, bad).

## Running it from autorip

[autorip](/autorip/) performs the entire flow automatically on disc insert, with a
configurable retry count and accepted-loss threshold, with no commands to type.
