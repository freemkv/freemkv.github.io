freemkv is a Rust workspace. This page maps the pieces and links to the detailed page for each. The CLI and the autorip service are both thin front ends over one shared library.

## libfreemkv

The core engine. It owns the mapfile and multipass recovery model, sector-level retry, AACS and CSS decryption, and MKV muxing. Everything else consumes it.

Published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/libfreemkv). For current API signatures, see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/freemkv/libfreemkv) — the generated docs on docs.rs can lag the latest source.

See the [library overview](/libfreemkv/).

## freemkv

The command-line front end, for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Every operation is a `scheme://` stream URL: rip a disc to MKV, copy a disc to an ISO, remux an existing image, inspect a disc, or refresh the key database.

See the [CLI reference](/cli/). Get a binary from the [Download](/download/) page.

## autorip

A cross-platform rip service (Linux, macOS, Windows). It auto-detects optical drives, runs the full sweep, patch, and mux pipeline on disc insert, and exposes a web UI for settings, live progress, and history. Resumable, with a configurable accepted-loss threshold. Runs as a single binary, or via Docker on Linux.

See the [autorip service](/autorip/). Published to GHCR at `ghcr.io/freemkv/autorip:latest`.

## freemkv-keysources

Pluggable AACS key sources for libfreemkv: a key database file, an online key service, or a mapfile-derived source. This is how [decryption keys](/decryption-keys/) reach the decryption pipeline.

Published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/freemkv-keysources).

## bdemu

A Blu-ray disc emulation component for testing the recovery and decryption paths without a physical disc in a drive.

## How they fit together

![How freemkv's components fit together: freemkv-keysources supplies keys to the libfreemkv engine (recovery, sector retry, AACS/CSS decrypt, MKV mux), which is composed by the freemkv CLI and the autorip service; bdemu is a test fixture.](/architecture.svg)

bdemu sits alongside as a test fixture for the recovery and decryption paths.
